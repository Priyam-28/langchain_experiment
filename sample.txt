LangGraph is an open-source framework built on top of LangChain that enables the creation of stateful, multi-step applications using language models. It introduces a graph-based architecture where nodes represent operations (like calling an LLM or a tool), and edges define transitions based on outputs or conditions.

This allows developers to build complex reasoning workflows, with capabilities such as branching logic, tool integration, memory management, and human-in-the-loop control. LangGraph supports persistence of state, making it easier to build agents that retain context and handle iterative interactions.

It is ideal for use cases such as question answering, document summarization, customer support bots, and intelligent tutoring systems. LangGraph integrates seamlessly with LangChain tools and agents, providing flexibility, composability, and robustness.
